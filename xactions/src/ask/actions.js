 * Answer-to-action matching for Ask XActions.
 *
 * An explanation is only half of what someone asking "how do I unfollow
 * everyone" wants. The other half is the thing they run. This ranks the
 * catalog in dashboard/data/ask-actions.json (built by
 * scripts/build-ask-actions.mjs from the real scripts, CLI and MCP surfaces)
 * against a question and the passages retrieval already found, and returns
 * the browser script to paste, the terminal command to type, and the MCP tool
 * an agent should call.
 *
 * The retrieved sources matter as much as the question text: a passage from
 * docs/examples/unfollow-everyone.md is direct evidence that
 * src/unfollowEveryone.js is the answer, and it survives phrasing
 * ("clean out my following", "start fresh") that no keyword match would.
 *
 * Runs unchanged in Node, the Cloudflare Worker and the browser.
